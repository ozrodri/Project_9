# Project_9
This is a deep dive into my Spotify extended Streaming history. I am working with my personal data, so I will not be uploading it to the repo.

This project was inspired by the Spotify Wrapped Feature: https://newsroom.spotify.com/2022-wrapped/

I wanted to focus on my time spent listening to my top songs per year. In addition, I also wanted to look at my time spent listening per month for each year. I had data from 2014-2023.

I also did a deep dive into my favorite song looking at the locations in which I have listened to it and my time spent listening to it per month.
